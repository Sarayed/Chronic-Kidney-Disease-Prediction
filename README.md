## ðŸŽ‰ Introduction
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a serious medical condition that can lead to various health complications. Early detection and classification of CKD play a crucial role in effective management and treatment. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to build models capable of classifying individuals into different CKD stages based on relevant clinical data.




## ðŸ¤– Models
We have implemented and compared multiple machine learning models for kidney disease classification, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)


The models are trained and evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to ensure their performance.
